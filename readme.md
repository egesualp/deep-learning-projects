# Deep Learning Practice Repo

In this repository, I will practice and experiment with various deep learning techniques in different contexts. The goal is to improve my understanding of deep learning by working on a variety of tasks and challenges.

## Objectives

- Explore and implement different deep learning architectures (e.g., CNNs, RNNs, LSTMs, GANs).
- Experiment with various datasets and problem domains, such as image classification, time series forecasting, natural language processing, and more.
- Practice using popular deep learning frameworks like PyTorch, TensorFlow, and Keras.
- Learn best practices for training, evaluating, and fine-tuning deep learning models.
- Share my learning progress and experiments in the form of code, notebooks, and documentation.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/egesualp/deep-learning-projects.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project folder:
    ```bash
    cd your-repo
    ```

3. Set up the environment and install the required dependencies:
    - Install the dependencies using `pip` or `conda` depending on your setup.
    - Example with pip:
      ```bash
      pip install -r requirements.txt
      ```

4. Explore the notebooks and scripts in the repository to follow along with the experiments.
